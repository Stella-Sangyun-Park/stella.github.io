<h2>WEB</h2>
<p><strong>The World Wide Web (WWW)</strong>, commonly known as the Web, is an
information system where documents and other web resources are identified by
Uniform Resource Locators, which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are
accessible over the Internet. The resources of the Web are transferred via the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software
application called a web browser, and are published by a software application
called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose
technologies the Web is built.</p>
